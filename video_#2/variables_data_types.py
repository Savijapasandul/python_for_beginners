## Variables

number = 10
text = "Tommy"
list123 = [1, 2, 3, "string1", "string2"]

print(number)

# number = 20

# print(number)

# # Creating and using variables
# name = "Alice"        # String variable
# age = 30              # Integer variable
# height = 5.5          # Float variable

# # Accessing variables
# print("Name:", name)  # Outputs: Name: Alice
# print("Age:", age)    # Outputs: Age: 30
# print("Height:", height)  # Outputs: Height: 5.5

# # Modifying variables
# age = 31              # Change the value of age
# print("New Age:", age)  # Outputs: New Age: 31

# # Changing type of variable
# age = "thirty-one"    # Now age is a string
# print("Age as text:", age)  # Outputs: Age as text: thirty-one

# ### In this example:
# # We create and initialize variables with different types of data.
# # We access and print the values of these variables.
# # We modify the value of `age`.
# # We change the type of `age` from an integer to a string, demonstrating Python's dynamic typing.

### Data types

# # Integer
# age = 25
# print("Age:", age)  # Outputs: Age: 25

# # Float
# price = 19.99
# print("Price:", price)  # Outputs: Price: 19.99

# # String
# name = "Alice"
# print("Name:", name)  # Outputs: Name: Alice

# # Boolean
# is_student = True
# print("Is student:", is_student)  # Outputs: Is student: True

# # List # mutable (can edit)
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print("Fruits:", fruits)  # Outputs: Fruits: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# # Tuple # immutable (can't edit)
# point = (10, 20)
# print("Point:", point)  # Outputs: Point: (10, 20)

# # Dictionary (keys must unique, and keys are immmutable)
# person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "is_student": True}
# print("Person:", person)  # Outputs: Person: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'is_student': True}

# # Set
# unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# print("Unique numbers:", unique_numbers)  # Outputs: Unique numbers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
